            <p id="intro"> In this website we can delve into the world of cinema and history, from the oldest cinema to the most current.</p>
            
            <p id="intro"> Cinema represents reallity plastically. It reflects the mentality.It represents the mentality of an era and is, in turn, a means of mass comunication.</p>

            <p id="intro"> Cinema, considered <i>the seventh art</i>, is a world in wich millions of different stories are told which, when we go to the cinemas or watch them at home, allow us to disconnect from reality and have a good time. All this is possible thanks to all the tems behind every project such as screenwriters, directors,actresses and actors, make-up temas, sound, effect and many more than work toghether to create this magnificient world that we can enjoy.</p>

            <h1 id="titulo1">History of cinema</h1>
            <h2 id="sub1">What we want to do in this web</h2>
            <p id="intro"> Cinematography is the illusion of movement by the recording and subsequent rapid projection of many still photographic pictures on a screen. Originally a product of 19th-century scientific endeavour, cinema has become a medium of mass entretainment and communications, and today it is a multi-billion-pund industry</p>

            <p id="intro"> No one person invented cinema. However, in 1891 the Edison Company successfully demonstrated a prototype of Kinetoscope, which enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures. The first public Kinetoscope demosntration took place in 1893. By 1894 the Kinetoscope was a commercial success, with public parlours established around the world.</p>

            <p id="intro">The first to present projected moving pictures to a paying audience were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. They used a device of their own making, the Cinématographe, which was a camera, a projector and a film printer all in one. We can see at the header of the page, the image of the "La lune de melies" as a product of the film "Voyage dans la Lune" directed by the mentioned Lumière brothers. </p>
            <p id="intro"> This personal project was born after the proposal to build a web page for a subject in the University.

            Here we try to bring art and people together for enjoyment, discovery and learning. We are willing to create a place where people of every background can learn and be captivated by cinema. We will show content that will strengthen the knowledge of cinema.

            </p> 
            <p id="intro">We believe in the power of art to help the imagination and provide enjoyment. Through this web we want to integrate art into people lives.</p>
            <p id="intro">We also want to create a little comunity where we can chat about all the things we watch because sometimes we can't talk with our closest ones about this topics because they don't like or know as much as us cinema.So here we can find ourselves in company with poeple who can bring opinions in all the series, docs, films,books, awards seasons or anything related to cinema.</p>
